# MA user analysis

Dimensions available for time-space exploration are:

FREQ = day, year-week, month, year
SCALE = gadm levels from 0 to 4, climate, biome, ecoregions
REPORT_TYPE = adult, bite, site
ENTITY = Total, *name of entity relative to SCALE*

## Global level

### User Retention (time series)
Percentage of users retained over a given interval of time. A valid user interaction is when a report is send. MA app installation is not considered a valid interaction.

Dimensions: scale, entity, freq, report_type
Parameters: retention_interval

### New users (time series)
Number of users that download and register the MA application. The location of this event is unvalidated and thus it's not possible to explore the *scale* dimension.

Dimensions: freq

### Active users (time series)
Dimensions: freq
Parameters: retention_interval

### Human-Sensor coverage (time series)
Percentage of user coverage It accounts for presence-absence of user on a given cell for a given time period (i.e. *freq*), but it does not account for the total or corrected number of users in a cell as the measure of *sampling effort*. It provides coverage for four categories of human density: urban cluster, rural cluster, rural low density and human absence.

Dimensions: scale, entity, freq

## UUID level

### Point Pattern Analysis (static)
For each user we compute dispersion statistics and clustering based on the relative geo-location of reports. Clustering is performed only for users with a given number of reports (+10). For users with only one report, no statistics are given. Clustering is performed after re-projection over the appropriate UTM zone.

Dimensions: scale, entity, report_type
Parameters: min_samples
Output statistics:
- n_points: validated and non-validated reports (bites, adult, sites)
- n_invalid_points: not valid points in relation to UTM zone
mean_latlon: mean geo-location
- std_utm msd_utm: std in UTM (meters) of all reports
- n_random_points: random points that are not part of any cluster
- n_clusters: number of clusters
- major_medoid_id: index of the biggest medoid
- medoids_lonlat: medoids of clusters
- name_gadm_level0: country name relative to the estimated origin of the user
- n_reports: validated mosquito reports used to estimate the quality measures
- quality_target: number of target-mosquito reports divided by the total number of mosquito reports send by a user
- quality_reports: cum-sum of expert confidence for target-mosquito reports divided by the total number of mosquito reports send by a user


### Image quality assessment (IQA)
Estimation by means of CNN of photographic quality of photos. It does not assess the information quality relative to the classification task, but rather the sharpness, contrast, etc. I ran the AI over *best photo* relative to a given report of *adult* mosquito.
