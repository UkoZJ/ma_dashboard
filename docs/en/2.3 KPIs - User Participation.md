<h2 style="font-size:14px">  User Participation </h2>

Displays the relative amount of **New Users** subscribing to the MA application within a given time window with at last one report uploaded. Users that installed the app but never submitted any type of report are not considered. The absolute count of new users for each period is normalized by the global maximum, making the peak subscription rate always equal to 100% and providing a consistent reference across the entire time series.

**Active Users** are those who have made at least one valid report upload within the last year. After a year of inactivity, it is assumed the user has uninstalled the application or become inactive. Active users represent only a fraction of new users, as the majority of MA users are one-time reporters.

**User Retention** is calculated as the percentage of users who upload a report within a specified interval after their previous upload. In this context, the interval is one year. Since this estimation is based on reports, it can be computed in relation to its geo-location *Entity*. For example, consider the following scenario for a year: at the beginning of the year, there were 100 active users (AU) who uploaded at least one report, but out of these 100 users, 80 users (RU) uploaded another report within the retention interval after their previous upload. The user retention rate is calculated as follows:

$$\text{User Retention} = \left( \frac{\text{RU}}{\text{AU}} \right) \times 100 = 80\\%$$

Finally, the time reference for new and active users is their registration time, while for user retention, it is the time of report upload.
