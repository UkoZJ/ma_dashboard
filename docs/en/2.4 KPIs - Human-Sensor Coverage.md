<h2 style="font-size:14px">  Human-Sensor Coverage </h2>

Displays the potential overall sampling capability of MA participants across a geographic location. Coverage is estimated based on background tracks from user mobile phones, providing a measure of the spread of human sensors independent of actual uploaded reports. This approach assesses the distribution of users over an area that indirectly allows to assess the potential sampling capacity of MA system.

Coverage is calculated using the [GHS built-up surface](https://human-settlement.emergency.copernicus.eu/download.php?ds=bu) raster with 0.025-degree cells for the year 2023. This raster differentiates between various human habitat areas (*Rural Low Density*, *Rural Cluster*, and *Urban Cluster*). A cell is considered covered by a human-sensor if at least one background track is detected during the specified time period, determined by the *Frequency* parameter. Shorter time windows (e.g., daily frequency) result in lower coverage.
