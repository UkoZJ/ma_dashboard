<h2 style="font-size:14px"> Reports Inflow </h2>

Displays the number of each report type uploaded by MA participants. The bars are stacked to show the total number of valid reports. Only reports with valid geo-location and not flagged as *"hidden"* are included. Additionally, only adult mosquito reports with more than one picture are considered since otherwise report validation is not feasible.
