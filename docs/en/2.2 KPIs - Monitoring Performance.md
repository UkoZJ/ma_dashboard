<h2 style="font-size:14px">  Monitoring Performance </h2>

Displays the median validation delay (white line <span style="color:#eeeeee">━</span>), the inter-quartile range (gray area <span style="color:#505765">▮</span>), and the count of report accumulation (blue line <span style="color:#8080ff">━</span>) on a logarithmic y-scale. The validation delay measures the time required for a report to be validated after being uploaded to the system. Ideally, a well-performing system should process all incoming reports daily, with a deviation of at most two weeks, to ensure effective near real-time surveillance and high user engagement. Report accumulation negatively impacts the delay, as older, non-validated reports add to the overall system delay.
